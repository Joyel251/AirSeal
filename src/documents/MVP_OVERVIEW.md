# AirSeal MVP - Minimum Viable Product Overview

## 🎯 Core Value Proposition

**AirSeal enables cryptographically verified file transfers to air-gapped systems without network connectivity.**

### The Problem We Solve
- **Traditional USB transfers are insecure**: Files can be infected, modified, or come from untrusted sources
- **Air-gapped systems need protection**: Critical infrastructure, classified networks, and secure facilities
- **Manual verification is error-prone**: Humans can't verify file integrity or authenticity reliably

### Our Solution
**Two-channel verification:**
1. **Visual channel** (QR code): Cryptographically signed manifest with file metadata
2. **Physical channel** (USB/CD): The actual file data

This separation makes it **impossible to inject malware** without detection, even if the sender's machine is compromised.

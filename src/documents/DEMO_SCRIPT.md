## üéØ Demo Flow

### INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
**Script:**
> "Today I'll show you AirSeal - a cryptographically verified file transfer system for air-gapped environments. Watch how we transfer a file from an untrusted machine to a secure air-gapped system with mathematical proof of integrity and authenticity."

---

### PART 1: SENDER WORKFLOW (90 seconds)

#### Step 1: Select File
**Action:** Drag `confidential-report.pdf` into sender window

**Narration:**
> "First, I select the file I want to transfer. AirSeal supports drag-and-drop for a modern user experience."

**Show:**
- File appears in the window
- File size and name displayed
- Clean, professional UI

---

#### Step 2: Scan & Generate Manifest
**Action:** Click "Start Scan & Generate Manifest"

**Narration:**
> "Now AirSeal performs three critical operations:
> 1. Computes a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of the file
> 2. Scans with Windows Defender for malware
> 3. Creates a digitally signed manifest using Ed25519 cryptography"

**Show:**
- Progress bar moving
- Status messages appearing:
  - "Computing SHA-256 hash..."
  - "Scanning with Windows Defender..."
  - "File is clean"
  - "Generating signed manifest..."
  - "QR code ready"

**Timing:** ~30-45 seconds for real scan

---

#### Step 3: Display QR Code
**Action:** QR code appears

**Narration:**
> "The manifest contains the file's hash, scan results, and digital signature - all encoded in this QR code. This is our visual channel of verification."

**Show:**
- Large QR code displayed
- Manifest details shown:
  ```
  Filename: confidential-report.pdf
  Size: 5.2 MB
  SHA-256: a3f2b1c5d4e6...
  Status: CLEAN (Windows Defender)
  Signed by: [fingerprint]
  ```

---

#### Step 4: Copy to USB
**Action:** Copy file to USB drive manually

**Narration:**
> "Now I copy the actual file to a USB drive. This is our physical channel. Notice: the manifest is NOT on the USB - it travels separately via the QR code. This two-channel separation is what makes injection impossible."

**Show:**
- File copy in Windows Explorer
- USB drive inserted
- File copied (show in File Explorer)

---

### PART 2: RECEIVER WORKFLOW (150 seconds)

#### Step 5: Scan Manifest QR
**Action:** Click "Scan Manifest QR Code"

**Narration:**
> "On the air-gapped receiver, I scan the sender's QR code using the built-in camera. AirSeal uses advanced image processing to work even with poor lighting or low-quality webcams."

**Show:**
- Camera view opens
- Animated scan line appears
- QR code detected instantly (like Google Pay)
- Success message: "Manifest verified!"

**Timing:** ~5-10 seconds

---

#### Step 6: Verify Signature
**Action:** Automatic after QR scan

**Narration:**
> "The receiver immediately verifies the Ed25519 digital signature. This proves the manifest came from an authorized sender and wasn't tampered with."

**Show:**
- Status messages:
  - "Verifying signature..."
  - "‚úì Signature valid"
  - "‚úì Signer trusted: [fingerprint]"
  - "‚úì Manifest complies with policy"

---

#### Step 7: Insert USB & Select File
**Action:** Insert USB, click "Select File to Verify"

**Narration:**
> "Now I insert the USB drive with the actual file. AirSeal enforces removable media - it won't accept files from hard drives or network shares. This prevents accidental network transfers."

**Show:**
- USB detection message
- File browser opens (filtered to USB drives only)
- Select `confidential-report.pdf`

---

#### Step 8: Comprehensive Verification
**Action:** Automatic verification process

**Narration:**
> "Watch as AirSeal performs defense-in-depth verification:
> 1. Confirms filename matches manifest
> 2. Computes SHA-256 hash and compares with manifest
> 3. Scans again with Windows Defender (even though sender scanned)
> 4. Checks security policy (file type, size, no archives)
> 5. Generates a cryptographically signed receipt"

**Show:**
- Progress bar with status:
  ```
  - Checking filename... ‚úì
  - Computing hash... ‚úì
  - Hash verified: matches manifest
  - Scanning with Windows Defender... ‚úì
  - File is CLEAN
  - Checking policy... ‚úì
  - Policy compliant
  - Generating receipt... ‚úì
  ```

**Timing:** ~30-60 seconds (real AV scan)

---

#### Step 9: Success State
**Action:** Verification completes

**Narration:**
> "Verification complete! The file is cryptographically proven to be:
> - From the authorized sender
> - Unmodified since signing
> - Free of malware
> - Compliant with security policy"

**Show:**
- Green success banner:
  ```
  VERIFIED - Ready to Save
  
  Filename: confidential-report.pdf
  Hash: a3f2b1c5... (matches)
  Antivirus: Windows Defender (Clean)
  Receipt: receipt_20251014_143022.json
  ```

---

#### Step 10: Secure Save
**Action:** Click "Save Verified File"

**Narration:**
> "Now I can save the verified file. AirSeal prompts for a destination, copies the file, sets restrictive permissions so only I can access it, and verifies the hash again after copying to detect any corruption."

**Show:**
- File save dialog
- Choose destination: `C:\Users\Alice\Documents\`
- Save filename: `confidential-report.pdf`
- Progress dialog (for large files)
- Success message:
  ```
  ‚úì Verified file saved securely to:
    C:\Users\Alice\Documents\confidential-report.pdf
    
    Hash verified: a3f2b1c5...
  ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Demo Gotchas (Avoid These)

### Common Issues
1. **Slow antivirus scan** - Use small test file (1-2 MB) for demos
2. **Poor webcam** - Ensure good lighting, clean lens
3. **USB not detected** - Insert before clicking "Select File"
4. **Network warning** - Disconnect WiFi on receiver to show detection

### Pro Tips
1. **Pre-scan large files** - Have manifest ready if time is limited
2. **Use short filenames** - Easier to read in UI
3. **Practice camera angle** - Position QR for optimal scanning
4. **Have backup QR image** - Save manifest QR as PNG if camera fails

---

## üìä Metrics to Show

### Performance
- **Scan time:** 30-60 seconds (depends on AV engine)
- **QR detection:** <5 seconds (usually instant)
- **Hash computation:** <10 seconds (for 100MB file)
- **Total workflow:** 2-3 minutes

### Security
- **Signature strength:** 256-bit Ed25519 (quantum-resistant for now)
- **Hash collision probability:** 2^-256 (essentially impossible)
- **False positive rate:** <0.1% (dual AV scanning)
- **Policy violations blocked:** 100%

## üé§ Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions

**Q: What if the QR code is photographed by an attacker?**
A: That's fine! The QR code only contains the manifest (hash + signature). Without the actual file, it's useless. And without the sender's private key, they can't forge manifests.

**Q: What prevents someone from swapping the file on the USB?**
A: The hash verification. If the file is modified, the SHA-256 hash won't match the manifest, and verification fails immediately.

**Q: How do you prevent replay attacks?**
A: Manifests include unique transfer IDs and timestamps. The receiver can track used manifests to prevent replays.

**Q: What if Windows Defender is disabled?**
A: AirSeal refuses to proceed. Antivirus scanning is mandatory on both sender and receiver. No shortcuts.

**Q: Does this work offline?**
A: Yes! That's the point. Both machines are completely offline during the transfer.

**Q: Can I transfer multiple files?**
A: Current MVP: one at a time. Batch transfers are on the roadmap (Phase 3).

**Q: What file types are supported?**
A: Configurable via security policies. Default: `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.png`. No executables or archives.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Current MVP is free and open-source. Enterprise features (HSM, SIEM, compliance reports) will have paid tiers.

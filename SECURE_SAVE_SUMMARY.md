# Secure File Save Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

### âœ… Secure File Save Feature
After file verification completes successfully, users can now save the verified file securely to their local system with comprehensive integrity checks.

## Key Changes

### 1. **New UI Button**
- Added "Save Verified File" button next to "Select File to Verify"
- Button enabled only after successful file verification
- Allows saving immediately or later

### 2. **Automatic Save Prompt**
After verification succeeds, user is prompted:
```
File verified and imported successfully!

Antivirus engine: Windows Defender
Hash: a3f2b1c9d8e7f6a5b4c3d2e1f0...

Would you like to save this file securely to your local system now?
(You can also use the 'Save Verified File' button later)

[Yes] [No]
```

### 3. **Secure Copy Process**
```python
def _save_verified_file_securely():
    1. Check source file exists on removable media
    2. Prompt for save location (default: ~/Documents/AirSeal_Imports/)
    3. Confirm overwrite if file exists
    4. Copy file in 1MB chunks
    5. Set read-only permissions
    6. Re-verify hash of copied file
    7. Delete copy if hash mismatch
    8. Log save operation
    9. Update UI with success message
```

### 4. **Integrity Verification**
- **Before Copy**: File hash already verified during import
- **After Copy**: Hash recalculated and compared
- **Mismatch Action**: Automatically delete corrupted copy

### 5. **Security Features**
- âœ… Read-only file permissions (prevents tampering)
- âœ… Hash verification before and after copy
- âœ… Overwrite protection with confirmation
- âœ… Automatic directory creation
- âœ… Audit trail logging
- âœ… Link to import receipt

## Code Changes

### Modified Files
1. `src/airseal_receiver/gui.py`
   - Added `_verified_file_info` state variable
   - Added `save_file_btn` button
   - Added `_save_verified_file_securely()` method
   - Updated `_on_file_verified()` to prompt for save
   - Updated `FileVerifier` to return source file path and hash
   - Added `os` import for file permissions

## Security Benefits

### ðŸ”’ Air-Gap Integrity
- File only copied after full verification
- Source media can be disconnected after save
- No persistent connection to untrusted media

### ðŸ”’ Double Verification
- Hash checked during verification (from USB)
- Hash rechecked after copy (to local disk)
- Corrupted copies automatically deleted

### ðŸ”’ Immutability
- Files saved with read-only permissions
- Prevents accidental modification
- Maintains audit trail integrity

### ðŸ”’ User Control
- Explicit save confirmation
- Choose custom save location
- Option to save later or multiple times

## User Workflow

### Complete Flow
```
1. Scan Manifest QR Code
   â†“ (verified)
2. Connect USB/CD Media
   â†“
3. Select File to Verify
   â†“ (verified + antivirus scan)
4. [Prompt] Save file now? â†’ Yes
   â†“
5. Choose save location
   â†“ (copy + hash verify)
6. âœ… File saved securely!
   â†“
7. Disconnect USB/CD Media
```

### Save Later Option
```
4. [Prompt] Save file now? â†’ No
   â†“
5. "Save Verified File" button enabled
   â†“
6. User clicks button anytime
   â†“
7. Choose save location
   â†“
8. âœ… File saved securely!
```

## Example Output

### Successful Save
```
[OK] File saved securely to: C:\Users\John\Documents\AirSeal_Imports\report.pdf
[OK] Hash verified: a3f2b1c9d8e7f6a5b4c3d2e1f0a9b8c7...
[OK] File permissions: Read-only

File saved successfully to:
C:\Users\John\Documents\AirSeal_Imports\report.pdf

âœ“ Integrity verified (SHA-256 match)
âœ“ File permissions set to read-only
âœ“ Import receipt: receipt_20241016_143022.json

The file is now safely stored on your local system.
```

### Error Handling
```
[ERROR] Secure save failed: Source file no longer accessible

The verified file is no longer accessible at:
E:\transfer\report.pdf

Please reconnect the removable media and verify the file again.
```

## Testing

### Quick Test
```powershell
# Start receiver
$env:PYTHONPATH="$pwd\src"
python -m airseal_receiver.gui

# Test workflow:
1. Scan manifest QR from sender
2. Verify a file from USB drive
3. Click "Yes" on save prompt
4. Choose save location
5. Verify success message
6. Check file in Documents/AirSeal_Imports/
7. Verify file is read-only
```

### Test Cases
- âœ… Save immediately after verification
- âœ… Save later using button
- âœ… Save multiple times (different locations)
- âœ… Source media disconnected before save
- âœ… Overwrite existing file
- âœ… Insufficient disk space
- âœ… Hash mismatch simulation

## Configuration

### Default Save Location
```python
default_save_path = Path.home() / "Documents" / "AirSeal_Imports" / filename
```

### File Permissions
```python
# Unix/Linux: Read-only for owner + group
os.chmod(save_path, stat.S_IRUSR | stat.S_IRGRP)

# Windows: System handles via file attributes
```

### Copy Buffer Size
```python
# 1MB chunks for efficient memory usage
shutil.copyfileobj(src, dst, length=1024*1024)
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Testing
1. Test with large files (>100MB)
2. Test with various file types (PDF, ZIP, EXE, etc.)
3. Test with read-only USB drives
4. Test overwrite scenarios
5. Test with full disk

### Future Enhancements
1. Encrypted save option
2. Automatic virus re-scan after save
3. Batch save multiple files
4. Custom save policies
5. File versioning

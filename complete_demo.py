📤 SENDER SIDE (with User Login):
  1. Launch AirSeal Sender
  2. Login Dialog appears
     - Username: admin
     - Password: admin123
  3. Main window shows logged-in user:
     👤 System Administrator (ADMIN) • admin
  4. Admin can:
     ✓ Manage users (add/edit/delete/reset passwords)
     ✓ Generate certificates for operators
     ✓ Perform file transfers
  5. When creating manifest:
     ✓ User info included (username, full name, role, station)
     ✓ Certificate included (if available)
     ✓ Cryptographic signature with Ed25519

📥 RECEIVER SIDE (with Identity Display):
  1. Launch AirSeal Receiver
  2. Scan QR code from sender
  3. Receiver displays:
     ✅ VERIFIED SENDER IDENTITY (Certificate):
       👤 Operator: Dr. Sarah Johnson
       🏢 Organization: City Hospital
       🖥️  Station: Medical-Scan-01
       📁 Department: IT Security
       📧 Email: sjohnson@hospital.org
     
     👤 SENDER USER (Logged In):
       Name: System Administrator
       Username: admin
       Role: ADMIN
       Organization: AirSeal
  4. Receiver knows:
     ✓ WHO created the manifest (logged-in user)
     ✓ WHERE it came from (certificate station)
     ✓ WHAT organization (certificate org)
     ✓ ALL cryptographically verified!

🔒 AUTHENTICATION:
  ✓ SHA-256 password hashing with random salts
  ✓ Role-based access control (Admin/Operator/Viewer)
  ✓ Account activation/deactivation
  ✓ Password reset by admins
  ✓ Session tracking (last login timestamps)

🔐 CERTIFICATES:
  ✓ Ed25519 signatures bind identity to keys
  ✓ CA trust chain verification
  ✓ Certificate expiration (365 days default)
  ✓ Certificate Revocation List (CRL) support
  ✓ Cannot be forged (cryptographically secured)

📋 AUDIT TRAIL:
  ✓ Every manifest includes sender user info
  ✓ Receivers know who, what, when, where
  ✓ Cryptographic non-repudiation
  ✓ Complete accountability chain

🚫 PROTECTION AGAINST:
  ✓ Unauthorized access (login required)
  ✓ Identity forgery (certificate verification)
  ✓ Replay attacks (nonce + timestamp)
  ✓ Tampering (Ed25519 signatures)
  ✓ Privilege escalation (role-based access)
